### Added
- Flickr thumbnail now also support albums, galleries and users
- Add a configuration option to disable session cookie protection
  Check this if your get disconnected often or your IP address changes often

  (although W3C-compliant, this may cause problems in some feed readers)

- A small bug (non-initialized variable) in page cache cleaning
- Proper "Nothing found" message when search returns no results
- No more 404 error when searching with empty input

## [v0.0.39beta](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:history) - 2012-08-10
### Added
- A cache for RSS feed, ATOM feed and Daily RSS feed, because these URLs
  are massively hammered. Cache is automatically purged whenever the database
  is changed. This will reduce server load. I may add cache to other pages later.

### Changed
- No more global `$LINKSDB` (Yuk)
- Background color was removed when hovering a link

### Fixed
- Small bug corrected in config screen on timezones
- Calling a non-existing permalink now returns a crude 404 error instead of 200 (OK)
  This is done on purpose
- The `shaarli` session cookie now has a proper path
  Thus you can now install several Shaarlis on the same server in different paths,
  and each will have its session
- Now when you delete a link, you go back the same page/search parameters you were on
- Restore previously removed `error_get_last()`, to ensure PHP 5.1 compatibility
  (Yes, now it works on free.fr hosting)
- Added `dialog=1` in bookmarklet code for some browsers

- When you click the key to see only private links, it turns yellow

### Changed
- The "Daily" page now automatically skips empty days. 

### Fixed
- Corrected the tag encoding (there was a bug when selecting a second tag which contains accented characters)


## [v0.0.37beta](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:history) - 2012-02-01
### Added
- Basic CSS for mobiles, which makes Shaarli //much// more usable on mobile devices
- Picture wall no more instantly kills your browser. Now it uses
  [lazy image loading](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload);
  the pictures are loaded only as you scroll the page.
  This will reduce browser memory usage (especially on mobile devices),
  as well as server load.
  If you have javascript disabled, the page will still work as before
  (all images loaded at once)
- RSS feed for the "Daily" page. 1 RSS entry per day, with all links of that day.
  RSS feed provides the last 7 days (only non-empty days are returned).
- In link list, added an icon to see only private links. Click to toggle (only private / all)


## [v0.0.36beta](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:history) - 2012-01-25

- Thumbnail support for http://xkcd.com/ (patch by Emilien Klein)
- Thumbnail support for http://pix.toile-libre.org/
- Well I had _some_ mercy for users with antique browsers (IE) which do not have
  support for gradients: I added a few `background-color`
- First version of the "Shaarli Daily", a page showing all links of a specific day.
  By default, you see the links of the previous day.
  There is still work to do on this page (error checking, better navigation (calendar?),
  RSS feed, CSS for mobile and printing...)

### Changed
- Upgraded bundled versions of jQuery (1.7.1) and jQuery UI (1.8.17)
- Upgraded bundled version of RainTPL (2.7)

        - COPYING licence file added
        - jQuery/jQuery-UI libraries removed to cope with Debian rules
          This version links to the libs hosted at http://code.jquery.com
    - rpm:
        - sources located in a subdirectory with the same name as the zip file
        - COPYING licence file added
    - WARNING: When downloading the .tar.gz, always use wget (and not your browser),
      otherwise the .tar.gz will be corrupted

- Permalinks now work even if additional parameters have been added
  (e.g. `/?E8Yj2Q&utm_source=blablabla...`)

- `user.css` can be added to overload Shaarli base CSS.(patch by Jerrywham).

### Added

  in the same directory as Shaarli's `index.php`

  respective specifications)

### Added
- Better CSS for printing (thanks to jerrywham suggestion)
- Allow using a redirector or anonymizing proxy for links

  (thanks to Accent Grave for the suggestion).
- The `ENABLE_LOCALCACHE` option can be set to `false` for those who have
  a limited quota on their host.
  This will disable the local thumbnail cache.

  when you upgrade Shaarli.
  Just add the file `data/options.php`.

- Shaarli page title is clickable (and has the same link as "Home")

- Support for thumbnails for flickr.com
- Allow staying signed in:
  Your session will be kept open even if you close the browser.
  This is available through a checkbox in the login screen.

### Changed
- Some hosts (flickr, vimeo) are slow as hell for the thumbnails,
  or require an extra HTTP request.
  For these hosts the thumbnail generation has been deported outside the generation
  of the page to keep Shaarli snappy.
  For these slow services, the thumbnails are also cached.

### Fixed
- Title was not properly passed if you had to login when using the bookmarklet (patch by shenshei)


## [v0.0.21beta](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:history)
### Added
- Thumbnails for some services
  Currently supports: YouTube.com, dailymotion.com, vimeo.com (slow!) and imgur.com.
  Thumbnails are enabled by default, but you can turn them off
  (set `define('ENABLE_THUMBNAILS',true);` to `false`).

### Changed
- Removed the focus on the searchbox (this is cumbersome when you want to browse pages
  and scroll with the keyboard)


## [v0.0.20beta](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:history)
### Fixed

- Preliminary tag cloud (ugly for the moment, I need to find something better)

### Changed
- Replaced `preg_match()` with `version_compare()` to check PHP version

### Fixed

### Added
- You no longer need to disable `magic_quotes` on your host.
