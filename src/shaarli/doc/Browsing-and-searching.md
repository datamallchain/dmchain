## Plain text search

Use the `Search text` field to search in _any_ of the fields of all links (Title, URL, Description...)

**Exclude text/tags:** Use the `-` operator before a word or tag (example `-uninteresting`) to prevent entries containing (or tagged) `uninteresting` from showing up in the search results.

**Exact text search:** Use double-quotes (example `"exact search"`) to search for the exact expression.

Both exclude patterns and exact searches can be combined with normal searches (example `"exact search" term otherterm -notthis "very exact" stuff -notagain`)

## Tags search

Use the `Filter by tags` field to restrict displayed links to entries tagged with one or multiple tags (use space to separate tags).  

**Hidden tags:** Tags starting with a dot `.` (example `.secret`) are private. They can only be seen and searched when logged in.

Alternatively you can use the `Tag cloud` to discover all tags and click on any of them to display related links.

## Filtering RSS feeds/Picture wall

RSS feeds can also be restricted to only return items matching a text/tag search: see [RSS feeds](RSS-feeds.html).
