#Sharing button
### Add the sharing button (_bookmarklet_) to your browser

 * Open your Shaarli and `Login`
 * Click the `Tools` button in the top bar
 * Drag the **`✚Shaare link` button**, and drop it to your browser's bookmarks bar.

_This bookmarklet button is compatible with Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari. Under Opera, you can't drag'n drop the button: You have to right-click on it and add a bookmark to your personal toolbar._

### Share links using the _bookmarklet_

 * When you are visiting a webpage you would like to share with Shaarli, click the _bookmarklet_ you just added.
 * A window opens.
  * You can freely edit title, description, tags... to find it later using the text search or tag filtering.
  * You will be able to edit this link later using the ![(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaarli/Shaarli/master/images/edit_icon.png) edit button.]((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaarli/Shaarli/master/images/edit_icon.png)-edit-button..html)
  * You can also check the “Private” box so that the link is saved but only visible to you. 
 * Click `Save`.**Voilà! Your link is now shared.**
