# Plugins

## Installation

For plugins shipped with Shaarli, no installation is required.

If you want to install a third party plugin, download it to the `plugins` directory in Shaarli's installation folder:

```bash
# example directory structure
| index.php
| plugins/
|---| custom_plugin/
|   |---| custom_plugin.php
|   |---| ...

```

Make sure your webserver can read and write the files in your plugin folder.


## Configuration

From Shaarli's administration page (`Tools` link), go to `Plugin administration`. Here you can enable and disable all plugins available, and configure them.

## Order

In the plugin administration page, you can move enabled plugins to the top or bottom of the list. The first plugins in the list will be processed first.

This is important in case plugins depend on each other. Read plugins READMEs for more information.

**Use case**: The (non existent) plugin `shaares_footer` adds a footer to every shaare in Markdown syntax. It needs to be processed *before* (higher in the list) the Markdown plugin. Otherwise its syntax won't be translated in HTML.


## Configuration file

Enabled plugins are stored in your [Configuration file](Shaarli-configuration), under the array:

```php
$GLOBALS['config']['ENABLED_PLUGINS']
```

You can edit them manually here. For example:

```php
$GLOBALS['config']['ENABLED_PLUGINS'] = array(
    'qrcode',
    'archiveorg',
    'wallabag',
    'markdown',
);
```
