# Installation

Once your server is [configured](Server-configuration.md), install Shaarli:

## From release ZIP

To install Shaarli, simply place the files from the latest [release .zip archive](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases) under your webserver's document root (directly at the document root, or in a subdirectory). Download the **shaarli-vX.X.X-full** archive to include dependencies.

```bash
wget https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases/download/v0.11.1/shaarli-v0.11.1-full.zip
unzip shaarli-v0.11.1-full.zip
sudo rsync -avP Shaarli/ /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org/
```

## From sources

These components are required to build Shaarli:

- [Composer](dev/Development.md#install-composer) to manage third-party [PHP dependencies](dev/Development#third-party-libraries).
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to build frontend dependencies.
- [python3-virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) to build local HTML documentation.

Clone the repository, either pointing to:

- any [tagged release](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases)
- `latest`: the latest tagged release
- `master`: development branch

```bash
# clone the branch/tag of your choice
$ git clone -b latest https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli.git /home/me/Shaarli
# OR download/extract the tar.gz/zip: wget https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/archive/latest.tar.gz...

# enter the directory
$ cd /home/me/Shaarli
# install 3rd-party PHP dependencies
$ composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
# build frontend static assets
$ make build_frontend
# build translations
$ make translate
# build HTML documentation
$ make htmldoc
# copy the resulting shaarli directory under your webserver's document root
$ rsync -avP /home/me/Shaarli/ /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org/
```

## Set file permissions

Regardless of the installation method, appropriate [file permissions](dev/Development.md#directory-structure) must be set:

```bash
# by default, deny access to everything to the web server
sudo chown -R root:www-data /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org
sudo chmod -R u=rwX /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org
# allow read-only access to these files/directories
sudo chmod -R g+rX /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org/{index.php,application/,plugins/,inc/}
# allow read/write access to these directories
sudo chmod -R g+rwX /var/www/shaarli.mydomain.org/{cache/,data/,pagecache/,tmp/}
```
