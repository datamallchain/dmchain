# Theming

## Foreword

There are two ways of customizing how Shaarli looks:

1. by using a custom CSS to override Shaarli's CSS
2. by using a full theme that provides its own RainTPL templates, CSS and Javascript resources

## Custom CSS

Shaarli's appearance can be modified by adding CSS rules to:

- Shaarli < `v0.9.0`: `inc/user.css`
- Shaarli >= `v0.9.0`: `data/user.css`

This file allows overriding rules defined in the template CSS files (only add changed rules), or define a whole new theme.

**Note**: Do not edit `tpl/default/css/shaarli.css`! Your changes would be overridden when updating Shaarli.

## Themes

Installation:

- find a theme you'd like to install
- copy or clone the theme folder under `tpl/<a_sweet_theme>`
- enable the theme:
    - Shaarli < `v0.9.0`: edit `data/config.json.php` and set the value of `raintpl_tpl` to the new theme name:
      `"raintpl_tpl": "tpl\/my-template\/"`
    - Shaarli >= `v0.9.0`: select the theme through the _Tools_ page

## Example installation: AlbinoMouse theme

With the following configuration:

- Apache 2 / PHP 5.6
- user sites are enabled, e.g. `/home/user/public_html/somedir` is served as `http://localhost/~user/somedir`
- `http` is the name of the Apache user

```bash
$ cd ~/public_html

# clone repositories
$ git clone https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli.git shaarli
$ pushd shaarli/tpl
$ git clone https://github.com/alexisju/albinomouse-template.git
$ popd

# set access rights for Apache
$ chgrp -R http shaarli
$ chmod g+rwx shaarli shaarli/cache shaarli/data shaarli/pagecache shaarli/tmp
```

Get config written:
- go to the freshly installed site
- fill the install form
- log in to Shaarli

Edit Shaarli's [configuration](Shaarli-configuration):
```bash
# the file should be owned by Apache, thus not writeable => sudo
$ sudo sed -i s=tpl=tpl/albinomouse-template=g shaarli/data/config.php
```
