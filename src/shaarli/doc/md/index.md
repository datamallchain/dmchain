### Demo

You can use this [public demo instance of Shaarli](https://demo.shaarli.org).
It runs the latest development version of Shaarli and is updated/reset daily.

Login: `demo`; Password: `demo`

Docker users can start a personal instance from an [autobuild image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shaarli/shaarli/). For example to start a temporary Shaarli at ``localhost:8000``, and keep session data (config, storage):
```
MY_SHAARLI_VOLUME=$(cd /path/to/shaarli/data/ && pwd -P)
docker run -ti --rm \
         -p 8000:80 \
         -v $MY_SHAARLI_VOLUME:/var/www/shaarli/data \
         shaarli/shaarli
```

A brief guide on getting starting using docker is given in [Docker 101](docker/docker-101).
To learn more about user data and how to keep it across versions, please see [Upgrade and Migration](Upgrade-and-migration) documentation.
