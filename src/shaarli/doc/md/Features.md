### Main features
Shaarli is intended:

- to share, comment and save interesting links and news
- to bookmark useful/frequent personal links (as private links) and share them between computers
- as a minimal blog/microblog/writing platform (no character limit)
- as a read-it-later list (for example items tagged `readlater`)
- to draft and save articles/ideas
- to keep code snippets
- to keep notes and documentation
- as a shared clipboard between machines
- as a todo list
- to store playlists (e.g. with the `music` or `video` tags)
- to keep extracts/comments from webpages that may disappear
- to keep track of ongoing discussions (for example items tagged `discussion`)
- [to feed RSS aggregators](http://shaarli.chassegnouf.net/?9Efeiw) (planets) with specific tags
- to feed other social networks, blogs... using RSS feeds and external services (dlvr.it, ifttt.com ...)
